SUPER METHANE BROTHERS PSP v1.4.8
---------------------------------

The port is based on V1.4.8 of a linux conversion of the game by Mark Page.


GAME PLAY
---------
Puff and Blow each have a Methane Gas Gun which fires a cloud of immobilising gas. 
If this comes into contact with a bad guy he will be absorbed into the gas and then float 
around the screen for a limited time. Bad guys are harmless in this state. Puff and Blow 
must suck the floating gas clouds into their guns and blast them out against a vertical 
surface. Bad guys then turn into bonuses which can be collected. Be warned! - the gas 
cloud dissolves with time after which baddies become active again and extremely annoyed.
